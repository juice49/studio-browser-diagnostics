# Studio Browser Diagnostics

Studio Browser Diagnostics is a tool to help determine whether a user's web browser and network are suitable for running Sanity Studio.

The tool can be run in guest mode, or a test document can be created in Sanity in order to provide a user with a dedicated test URL. Once tests have completed, the results will be saved to Sanity.
